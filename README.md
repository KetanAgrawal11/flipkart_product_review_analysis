# 🧠 Comprehensive Product Review Analysis (Classical NLP Approach)

This project performs **end-to-end NLP analysis** on customer reviews using **traditional NLP techniques** (no Transformers).  
It demonstrates how classical methods can extract meaningful insights, sentiment, and summaries from real-world product reviews.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Extract and clean customer reviews (from Flipkart)
- Translate multilingual text to English
- Perform linguistic analysis (POS tagging, NER)
- Conduct sentiment analysis (lexicon-based)
- Identify semantic relations between key features
- Summarize reviews and answer user queries

---

## 🏗️ Steps Implemented

1. **Web Scraping** – Collected product reviews using `BeautifulSoup`
2. **Preprocessing & Translation** – Cleaning, tokenization, and language translation
3. **POS & NER Analysis** – Extracting product-related entities and adjectives
4. **Sentiment Analysis** – Using polarity scoring and visualization
5. **Vector Semantics** – Word similarity via TF-IDF & cosine similarity
6. **Summarization** – Generating concise review summaries
7. **Interactive QA System** – Answering user questions based on review data

## 🧰 Tech Stack

**Languages & Libraries:**

- Python
- BeautifulSoup, Regex
- NLTK, Spacy, TextBlob
- Scikit-learn, Gensim
- Matplotlib, Pandas
- Googletrans (for translation)
