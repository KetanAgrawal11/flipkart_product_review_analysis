5,The best in the Range! Go for it...,"Value for Money: 4.5/5
Performance: 5/5
Build quality :4.5/5
Design 4.5/5
Noise 4/5(only drier makes a little noise)


Brief:

This was my first purchase of a Fully Automatic Machine. Been using for a Semi-automatic machine for the past 20 years, we finally decided to shift to a fully automatic machine. Having heard really bad feedback about the top load we decided on the front load. I shortlisted about 3 Brands in the budget - Samsung, LG, Bosch. Heard some quality issues with Bosch in Indian retails washing machines so that was out of the list. Got it for 24K in the BBD sale after card discounts.

Delivery:

Decided to buy Samsung because of the trust in the brand after looking at it in an offline store (Though, I feel LG has very slight edge on build quality). I loved the design on Samsung a little bit better. Coming to delivery, it was delivered after 8 days which is fine considering the BBD rush. Installation was done the next day by Samsung guys.

Installation:

The installation was smooth, and the staff was considerate of any requests. He offered a stand for 1600 and Cover for 500. I felt the quality was nice so decided to go for it!
He explained all the features with great patience. Basically, you are going to use Daily wash mode 90% of the time. I installed the machine in my bathroom, and it is fine.

Operations:

You turn on the machine and tap and choose the mode. 2 caps of liquid detergent and turn on the machine. The daily wash mode takes 66 minutes and try to use only 800 rpm as I feel like 1400 is going to affect the clothes. You can also choose the temperature of the heater. You can also choose from options like soiled for extra dirty clothes and rinse for rinsing the clothes a little longer. All of these options increase the washing time but gets the job done.

Performance:

The washing is perfect, Maybe I haven't experienced front load before but definitely much better than semi-automatic machine. You can also use rinse+ dry option to just dry the wet clothes. The heater dries up the clothes well) (I use 40 degrees to be on the safer side.) The moisture content after drying is about 20-25% which is pretty okay for the price. I have been using it for about a month and I have tried all types of different clothes like Bedsheets, cotton, synthetic, polyester, wool etc. All the stains are well vanished.

At a single load you can fit up to 11-12 normal clothes.
2-3 bedsheets
1-2 ac quilts


Overall, a very value for money washing machine with ample of features. If you have a little more budget, then go for the Wifi connected one. It has more user-friendly operations."
3,Decent product,"Delivery experience was horrible. Only one person has come for delivery. How can one person lift this 65kg item. Now customer has no choice other than to follow the delivery boy for lifting and placing it in my home. What kind of a delivery manner it is? What if only ladies at home? Does the Flipkart expect the same experience with women too? Flipkart must respond to this. Overall, good product with worst delivery experience."
5,Great product,"Excelent Machine. I was using top load machine from last 12yrs and switched to front load. Must say, it is more efficient then the top load machine. it take less water, cleaning efficiency is excelent. The AI feature auto detects the kind of load in and does the wash. As this machine is WiFi enabled you can connect it with your phone and with the confort of the app you can select the wash mode you want. Out of many Features i would like to highlight few of then which is really helpful for every day use. 1.It has got on option of Bubble Wash(here the clothes will be socked in the soap solution for some time and then wash starts) 2. Temp up to 90 degrees. you have option to select temprature from 40 to 90 degress. 3. you can customize the rinz cycle(i.e how many rinz cycle you want). 4. It may sound gimic to have WiFi enabled machine but its really useful as it will give so much informaiton about your machine. to name a few(it will tell you how many wash remaining for durm clean, how much energy you have used and also tells how much money has it consumed. It also gives you option to customized your wash preferrence via the app, so you need not have to be infrot of the machien rotating the nob everytime).Over all after using a top load washing machine form last 12yrs and moving to this machine was a really very good dicision that i took. I tried to share my experience of the machine, hopefully it will help others to take decision."
4,Value-for-money,Amazing product and good quality
4,Very Good,"Pros-
Enough wash cycle options on panel and low noise operation
Touch panel to select functions is better than tactile buttons
Clothes are washed as expected depending on the cycle selected. Earlier i thought top load washes better but front load is better in my opinion now.
Few wash cycle sprays water jet on clothes to remove detergent during rinse

Cons-
9kg Drum size looks the same as my old 6.5 kg top load machine. Before purchasing online, visit some stores to check if the drum size is as per expectation or not. Buy 12kg version of possible.
It has a quick wash option but it is meant for a few clothes.
Electricity consumption is higher
Sometimes clothes are not that dry. My Whirlpool top load used to dry better which had 800 rpm speed. Samsung has 1400 speed.
Not easy to throw soiled clothes in this one like we do in top loads. I feel frequent open close of the front door may loosen the lock and rubber gasket over time. Let's see.
The convenience of filling water from an external pipe or bucket when the water supply is gone is not something you can do here. Not a con but just highlighting if someone faces an irregular water supply."
3,Good,The technician who came to do the installation had no knowledge at all. How can the company get the installation done by such people! And he did not even install the installation parts in the washing machine which were provided by the company.
3,Fair,"Fast delivery, but delivery person demanded extra money of exchange washing machine, even his senior demanding extra money, installation was in hurry and not in a proper manner.

About product, first thing I've noticed that rat protection panel was of cardboard material, one can easily make this. Panel should be provided out of these plastic, steel or rubber.

Cycle stops thrice in between daily wash cycle on first day of usage which is not acceptable.

Overall I'm completely disappointed with flipkart services due to all this.

In return, flipkart is not being providing a plastic rat protection panel which should be given at the time of delivery or installation."
5,Awesome,Good
5,Great product,"We were used to front door of IFB and we have used for longer time 5 yrs with no concerns until it has some motor related issues. While changing to newer machine, I was looking to change the brand and explored. I found this model with Samsung has better features with multiple options. Its too early to share feed back.. but for past 10 days this works fine..

Best part if less noisy and not even know machine is running and beeps indicating machine completed. I am keeping my fingers crossed being Samsung is one of best supplier for home needs and am not anticipating any disappointment. May be I can share another feedback 6 months.

Thanks Flipkart on your delivery service with at most care and Jeeves team member was nice and took good care of Machine installation."
5,Super!,Value of money can’t expect
4,Good for the Job but AI doesn't give u much utility,"It's good for the job,
but kindly listen, AI and all these buzz words are useless after a couple of days, the Only AI it has is pattern learning and u can select from a mobile. It might complicate for the elder people."
5,Fabulous!,"Must Buy Value For Money
Very Good Performance"
5,Wonderful,"It’s an excellent machine…. Which do every thing on its own… hassle free
Less power consumption with
Huge water save when compared to top load
More over u can trust the brand lik Samsung
And installation was done on next day
Aramsye it wil work for next 8 years
Peace ✌️ thank u Samsung"
4,Good choice,Nice product
3,Fair,"Rat mash is too poor quality, I don't know they're providing metal cover in bottom square of machine. I think it's bad strategy and cheating with customers, on second day after installation rats cuts my machines tub 😞"
3,Decent product,"After completion of program door lock not open . For this we have to switch off and switch ON the machine.
So if while running sudden light off then all clothes will stuck till light came.
Please update if any setting regarding this."
5,Must buy!,Good
5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Nice product
Thank you Samsung"
4,Delightful,"I bought it during BBD for 28K.

There are more than 10 modes available, one can also download additional modes from the smart things app and set the washing machine to use the downloaded mode, so some nice features are available, mostly we will use 2 to 3 modes at maximum.

The clothes after wash comes out almost 90% dried and kind of satisfied with wash quality, the eco bubble mode is better for clothes that are too dirty or soiled, obviously can't match the wash quality of hand wash but I can say it matches 80% of hand wash quality.

I was not happy with the delivery guys, they were not friendly and were reluctant to deliver the product to the second floor, they were trying to keep the product on the ground floor and get away and needed a lot of convincing."
5,Wonderful,"I got this for 28 K, i saw many brands but finally i decided to buy samsung because the samsung drum size is little bigger than other brands and i got a really good one with good price
This machine wash cloths very nicely with less sound
I suggest please go for this and buy without any doubt"
5,Perfect product!,"Excellent,never expected.And its looking very glamorous.And it's the new version with new MFG On August 2023."
5,Awesome,This is very good washing machine and value for money and it makes very less noice and its drum is very big and consumes very less water and electricity so dont waste your time for searching washing go for it
5,Just wow!,"First time using a Samsung Home appliance
The experience is very good .
Received a call from Samsung service centre within 2 hrs of delivery . The technician assigned was very skilled and understanding . Thumbs up to Samsung for the fast installation and demo .
Coming to the washing machine :
1. Very silent .
2. Uses very little water .
3. Best for people who don't want complicated modes , Very simple usable modes .
4. Soak mode is very good ( recommended to use always) .
First time ordering a Big Home appliance from Flipkart. The delivery guys were very good ...

Suggestion : For users upgrading from an old washing machine to a new one ... Please take help from a plumber by installing a washing machine tap or a angular valve before the installation of the washing machine ."
3,Does the job,Touch panels are not visible.. also one touch option is not working properly
5,Classy product,"After lot of confusion which brand to bought , i choosen samsung 8kg machine this model. First of all , look wise good and low noise and power rating as 5 star are advantage. Further it has user friendly. if you wants to buy 8kg machine with in 30k you could choose this one. Budget is not a pbm you can choose bosch ifb.Because Bosch and ifb brands are the best for washing machine."
5,Best in the market!,Nice person on installation. Appreciated A+++++
4,Good quality product,"Everything is good about the machine, but installation and demo is a big zero, if bought from Flipkart.
I have raised a concern with Flipkart regarding this, but no action was taken.
I would request Flipkart to have a better installation support team."
5,Classy product,Nice make
4,Nice product,"This is Completely My After 4 Months Of Using Review .

3) The Third Thing Is The Product Noise Levels Are Slightly Low And Minimal
4) The Fourth Thing Is Maintenance This Product Is Generally Having No Maintenance But Yearly 3 Times Drum Cleaning Cause Drum Grem Free And Smell Free

5,Fabulous!,Excellent product. Go for it.
5,Highly recommended,"Nice product with IoT. You can control the machine with mobile. Elegant design, and good performance.

Delivery was quick and installation was also done by Flipkart."
5,Must buy!,"Superb,one month experience, samsung eco bubbles 8kg go for it,less noise, washing quality is terrific,full storage 60ml -90ml detergent liquid is enough,Inox grey colour is nice, almost 80% drying full complete circle, clothes are without wrinkles than hand wash."
4,Delightful,"It is a washing expert and full of advanced technologies.its ecobubble technology is wonderful,uses less amount of detergent but creates bubbles to make the cloth new like clean.you can manually select the temperature,spin and rinsing time and you can also select the washing mode by using the smart things app and it's blackish grey look gives it a dashing look.you can't help looking at it.the only cone is that it cannot take much load to be more specific it cannot arrange the clothes properly before starting it's final spin and as a result of it ,it shakes.as it is a direct drive machine it makes little noise while washing but during final spin it starts shaking."
4,Pretty good,"I strongly recommend you all to not to buy wifi model.
Through wifi you can only control the program, nothing else.
You need to go to switch on the machine, start of machine after selecting program is also manual.

My expectations as a wifi model is- that i just need to put clothes in and on the main switch rest all like play the machine , selection of programme, on off the machine from machine not from switch board.

Wifi is waste just waste in this. Just go for the without wifi model and save extra money."
4,Really Nice,Best product in this range
4,Good choice,"Good product, rat mesh quality is very bad"
3,Decent product,"The wifi connectivity is useless, it doesn't start through mobile"
3,Good,While start of rinse there will be high vibration for 10 seconds.
5,Simply awesome,"This machine is super powerful, front load washers are way superior than the top load washers.

Its weight is around 70 kg whereas the top load weighs around 31 kg. It's a freaking Jet when it comes to performance, choose front load any day rather than the top load.

Also I have washed a double bed heavy blanket in this 12 kg one and it was a cake walk for this machine."
5,Terrific,"You can go with your eye shut.
Good performance till date have used most functions and does the job well.
AI does good job by suggesting our preferred wash cycles after a week of usage."
5,Wonderful,"Overall a great buy from samsung. Used to top load machines but this front load performs better than top load with less noise and some additional features. Better for 3-4 person family. 8kg machine can easily fit 10-15 clothes at a time. Card offers are good as its available all time.

Pros:
Noise free compared to other machines.
Better wash and added features with hygiene steam.

Cons:
Inlet valve might have been bit long.
Rat mesh quality could have been better.
Wifi enabled features are not upto mark."

5,Fabulous!,"My mother's age is nearing 60 now.
Seeing her get tired from washing clothes at this age makes my heart ache.

I had been planning to buy a washing machine for my mother for a long time, but due to voltage issues in our area, I could not buy one earlier.

Now that the voltage problem has been resolved, I have finally purchased this as a gift for my mother; to ease her burden.

I chose this one because it's a future-proof machine; Wi-Fi enabled and fully controllable through the Samsung SmartThings app."

5,Awesome,"Super Product

5,Terrific,"Writing this review after almost 15 days of use. Buy stand first and foremost requirment.
U can bargain with service engineer. Very less sound while washing. Little bit of sound while spinning at 1400 rpm, which is ok and all washing machine does make that sound.
Performance is quite good. Weight is good, so it does not wobble too much, for which i was worried initially. But all good and everyone can buy it. Features are good and it also removes stains from collar, which i had not expected. There is also a 15 minute wash cycle, prolonged cycles r also there. Drum clean, drum dry all is there. So 9 out of 10 from my side."

1,Don't waste your money,Product is making loud rattling noise
1,Very poor,"Genuine review:

Samsung 8.0 kg , the quality of drum is very poor. very light. Not so strong . When knock on the drum, the sound itself speaks of low quality. I had 7.5 kg MARQ front load washing machine. Very robust, drum strong, good build quality. Outer front body got rust with time. It ran 5 years. 2 times per day. 365 days for 5 years.

The door nut and bolt and its fixation with the machine body is of poor quality. If by mistake if you open the door with jolt/ by force, to its maximum opening, the door will unpluck and will come out in your hand. Feels like this.

If by mistake, you are walking and collides with the already open gate at opposite, the door will get unpluck easily and fall on floor. Very cheap quality material.

Buttons available are also not so smooth.

The door lock knob is also very cheap.

Overall, The materials used is of low/cheap quality to compensate with 20 years motor warranty. Adding new features+warranty+low in price/budget= balancing with cheap drum and materials.

Handle with care.
Will review after installation of product and washing the clothes .

One suggestion: Which ever product you want to buy on flipkart, first go in shop and check its drum quality and buttons etc. and decide and purchase.
I guess but not sure, the company makes two types of product 1. for shops. good quality and 2. for online sale. average quality.May be also online product is of low quality with low rate. Shop price is high, may be product quality is good.
I have purchased, so i will not return now.

By look the product looks very attractive. For first time user, they will love the product. Those who have already used other washing machine of good quality, and then purchase these products, they dont like it .

However, online provides middle classes people to buy at budgetary level."
3,Nice,Waste water intake problem
3,Does the job,"All about buy it for wifi oprations that can operate remotely from anywhere, but it's not like that needs physical operation.Disappointment for that."
3,Working Fine,"After using this washing machine for few days, I found out that AI part is mostly gimmick. I am using basic feature to wash my clothes"

4,Good quality product,Fastest delivery by Flipkart little bit delay on installation demo. Product is good design is awesome.
4,Very Good,"Overall the Machine is very good for small families, with multiple wash modes. The Inlet pipe provided by Samsung is small hence if the washing machine is placed far from the water source, it is advisable to buy extra length. The Wash Quality is good and I have tried normal and winter clothes."
4,Good choice,Good
4,Pretty good,In this machine everything is okay apart from this the program is in built which is given Sometimes it needs to be customised like 60 degree Celsius and 20 minutes so this type of customisation one option or mode is not available but from that everything is okay.
5,Fabulous!,"The product is very good.
The delivery was fast.
The installation was also fast. But the technician is not that
knowledgeable. Overall thanks to flipkart and the team."
5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Bought 8kg fully automatic load for 28k in sale. I'm loving my new 8kg fully automatic washing machine! It's so convenient and easy to use. Just add clothes, detergent, and select the cycle - done! It saves me time and effort. Cleaning is thorough, and it's quiet too. Highly recommend!"
5,Classy product,"Never thought I would buy a washing machine online. I was having so many questions before purchase.
Big thanks to Flipkart for smooth purchase and installation.
Reviewing after a month of use. This product is more than perfect with almost zero noise. Made for heavy wash. This washing machine has unique features like hygiene wash. This is the best in the market. It's costly but value for the price.
cleaning is superb. Never doubt samsung.
Thankyou Flipkart 🙃"

3,Fair,Heavy vibration
5,Brilliant,Nice design and good performance. I've been using the IFB machine for the last 20+ years. Need to check if Samsung can deliver similar durability. Only installation got delayed by a day. Other than that I had a good experience.
5,Brilliant,"Like this Samsung 8 kg washing machine I think it is the best washing machine under 32000.......
watch quality is very good but it require a booster pump in my hose condition.।।।।।।
So do not consider this washing machine if you low water pressure problem.।।।।।।
Other than that than this washing machine is very good you can definitely check ☑ this out.।।।।।।"

5,Classy product,"Excellent machine best in front load 7-9 kg segment.
Pros:
There is no vibration in 1200 RPM spinning
Perfect wash quality
Superb build quality
Beautiful design
Low power and water consumption
No sound
Cons: ( won't say Cons but scope of improvements to make it perfect)
Water drain pipe could have been better

Overall value for money. Go for it without a second thought.
I bought it during the Diwali sale (26918)and got some good deals.
Actually, MRP is mentioned 49999, but in samsung official website, the actual cost of this product 29999. If it's higher than this anywhere, please check once in the manufacturer website.

Thanks, Flipkart, for providing such a wonderful service and always my trusted platform."
